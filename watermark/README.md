## Installation Instructions
This script requires two files: a JavaScript file and a CSS file.

Download or copy both the [BlueMapWatermark.js](BlueMapWatermark.js) script file
and the [BlueMapWatermark.css](BlueMapWatermark.css) style file to your webapp, and register them.

Here is a [guide for the registering js file](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/Customisation.html#webapp-script-addons)
and a [guide for the registering css file](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/Customisation.html#theme-and-look).

## Options
In the JavaScript file, you can change the `anchor.href` link to change the link the watermark goes to when clicked.
And you can change the `watermarkImage.src` link to change the actual image of the watermark.

In the CSS file, you can change the placement and the size of the watermark.
