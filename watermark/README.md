# Watermark
If you want to add a clickable watermark to your map, you've come to the right place!

Here's an example watermark image of the BlueMap logo:

## Setup Instructions

This script requires two files: a JavaScript file and a CSS file.  
Download or copy the JavaScript file ([BlueMapWatermark.js](BlueMapWatermark.js))
and the CSS file ([BlueMapWatermark.css](BlueMapWatermark.css)) and register them with BlueMap.

The guides on how to do that are here: [css guide](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/Customisation.html#theme-and-look) and [js guide](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/Customisation.html#webapp-script-addons).

## Options
In the JavaScript file, you can change the `anchor.href` link to change the link the watermark goes to when clicked.
And you can change the `watermarkImage.src` link to change the actual image of the watermark.

In the CSS file, you can change the placement and the size of the watermark.  
If you don’t know how to write CSS yet, here is a good guide: [developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
