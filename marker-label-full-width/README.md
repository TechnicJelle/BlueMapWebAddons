# Marker Label Full Width

This style makes marker labels full width, instead of the default width,
which often leads to unwanted line breaks.

## Customization

With this style, the marker labels will be the full width they may need, which could lead to very long lines.\
You can set a maximum width of the marker labels by editing the `max-width` property in the CSS file:
```css
max-width: 200px !important;
max-width: 50rem !important;
```
(Make sure to keep the `!important` flag.)
