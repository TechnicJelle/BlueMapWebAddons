# Custom Sidebar Button

There is currently no simple way to do this, sadly. The best way would be to clone the BlueMap webapp source code,
modify that, and recompile it.  
That is very complicated, though, and also a lot of effort.

Luckily, a community member [@Chicken](https://github.com/Chicken/) has devised a workaround to do this anyway! (Even if it's not ideal...)  
For this, we will make use of the BlueMap feature that allows us to inject any custom JavaScript snippets that we want.

To get started, you should create a `.js` file in your webroot (usually `/bluemap/web/`).  
Then you need to register that script with BlueMap, so it'll actually load it.  
You do this in `webapp.conf`, by putting the file name in the `scripts: [ ]` list.  
After adding it to the list, you need to reload BlueMap, so BlueMap applies the changes you've made to the configs.
You can do so with the `/bluemap reload light` command.

The following codeblock is the content of the script file. You can customise the text of the button by changing what's
inside the label div,
and you can change what it links to by replacing the link in the `a`'s `href` attribute.

`/bluemap/web/my-custom-button.js`:
```js
const buttonTemplate = document.createElement("template");
buttonTemplate.innerHTML = `
<a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/">
    <div class="simple-button">
        <div class="label">Visit BlueMap Website</div>
    </div>
</a>
`.trim();
const button = buttonTemplate.content.firstChild;

setInterval(() => {
    const buttonList = document.querySelector(".side-menu .content")?.children.item(0);
    if (buttonList && Array.from(buttonList.children).every(el => el.tagName === "HR" || el.className === "simple-button")) {
        buttonList.appendChild(button);
    }
}, 10);
```

`plugins/BlueMap/webapp.conf`:
```hocon
scripts: [
    "my-custom-button.js"
]
```

The example above will open your new button within the same window.  
To force it to open within a new/separate tab within your browser, immediately
after `href="https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/"`, include the following: `target="_blank"`.

Example:

```js
buttonTemplate.innerHTML = `
<a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/" target="_blank">
    <div class="simple-button">
        <div class="label">Visit BlueMap Website</div>
    </div>
</a>
`.trim();
```
