# Distance Measurer
This is a simple script that adds a distance measurer/ruler to your BlueMap website.

Disclaimer: I originally wrote this script as a very simple proof of concept,
and I never intended to make into a fully-featured and nice-to-use ruler add-on.
As such, it works, but it's not very user-friendly.  
PRs are welcome! But I am not likely to work on this myself any time soon.

## Usage
Just click two blocks after eachother, and a line between them will appear.  
If you click the line, it'll show the distance between them.

## Installation Instructions
Just copy the whole [BlueMapDistanceMeasurer.js](BlueMapDistanceMeasurer.js) file to your webapp and [register it](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/Customisation.html#webapp-script-addons).  
You don't need to edit the script at all for it to work.
